# Apollo ReduxForm

ReduxForm powered by Apollo and GraphQL

## Features

* Build forms from GraphQL mutations
* Init forms from GraphQL queries
* Store form state in Redux
* Submit forms via Apollo

## Roadmap

* select from enum
* buildForm options with name to specify the name of a mutation (see also apollo-react). In this way we can have only one big GraphQL spec. It is useful because mutation variables could have user defined types.
* can I manipulate variable values before passing them to mutation?
* ...
